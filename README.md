# Data Structures in C++

- This repository contains implementations of common data structures in C++. 

- they contain a main cpp file that shows how to use the data structure and a header file that contains the implementation of the data structure.
- run the main cpp file to see the data structure in action.
## Data Structures


- Stack
- Queue
- Linked List


## Getting Started

To use these data structures in your C++ projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Include the necessary header files in your C++ code.
3. Create instances of the data structures and use their methods as needed.
